## About me

I' m 24 years old and have no commercial experience. It would be sad, but it actually does not.  
Now I am hard-working under my studying to start my IT-career. I'm a student of RS-School (Stage 0 JS/Frontend-development) and Yandex.Practicum (Python development).

My goal is simple. I want to create useful projects which are make people's daily life is better and easily. 

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, as they say. So at first I must finish my education.  I'm sure I will be one of  the best students in both schools because i work under it even in free-time, getting better little by little every day.
